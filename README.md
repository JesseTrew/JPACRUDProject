## JPA CRUD Project

### Week 9 Homework Project for Skill Distillery

### Overview
This weeks homework objective is to perform simple CRUD on a single table database of your choosing and creation.

### How to Run
Run as a Spring Boot project from the JurassicParkApplication Java file.

### Technologies/Topics Used
This project required creating a database with a single table in MySQLWorkbench and mapping it to a JPA entity in STS. We are deploying the project to an AWS instance.

### Lessons Learned
This project was a great overview of all of the new technologies we've been introduced to lately. One of my main takeaways is that I would like to get more familiar with /Bootstrap and CSS. As of the due date, my site looks very plain Jane. I'll try to come back to it over this week and polish it up.

Otherwise, I really like how simple JPA and Spring Boot make the CRUD process. Compared to last week's project
